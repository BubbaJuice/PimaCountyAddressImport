# PimaCountyAddressImport
GEOJSON file containing over 400,000 addresses in Pima County, Arizona. This may not always be up to date with my local version but you can request one by filing an issue.

## What is this?
This repository hosts a compressed version of a GEOJSON file that I will theoretically use to import into the [OpenStreetMap Database](https://openstreetmap.org/).
