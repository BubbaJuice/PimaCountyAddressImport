# PimaCountyAddressImport
GEOJSON file containing over 400,000 addresses in Pima County, Arizona. This may not always be up to date with my local version but you can request one by filing an issue.

## What is this?
This repository hosts a compressed version of a GEOJSON file that I will theoretically use to import into the [OpenStreetMap Database](https://openstreetmap.org/).

For more information visit the [project page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:BubbaJuice/PimaCountyAddressImport).

## How can I view the file?
Simply download the file and open it in [JOSM](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM).

If you want to get fancy you can uncompress the file using gzip available on Linux or you can use 7zip on Windows. This will increase the file size to over 200mb though.
